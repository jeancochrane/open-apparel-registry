# Dedupe Examples for OAR

These examples are based on the
[dedupe-example](https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe-examples/) scripts.

## Requirements

- python 2.7+ or 3.4+

## Setup

- `cd {PROJECT-ROOT}/research/dedupe`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## dedupe

### Scripts

#### merge_lists.py

Usage: `python merge_lists.py /path/to/csv/directory facility_list_items.csv`

Creates `facility_list_items.csv` in the current working directory by combining
all the facility list CSVs in the specified source directory.

#### oar_dedupe_example.py

Usage: `python oar_dedupe_example.py`

Reads `facility_list_items.csv` from the current working directory runs through
an interactive training session and produces the following outputs:

  - facilities_output.csv - A copy of the input with additional columns with the
    output of the matching process.
  - facilities_training.json - The results of the interactive training session
  - facilities_learned_settings - The trained data model
  - facilities_deduped.csv - Deduplicated output where a winner is chosen from
    each cluster where the match confidence exceeds a threshold.

## gazetteer

### Scripts

#### oar_gazetteer_example.py

Usage: `python oar_gazetteer_example.py`

Reads `../dedupe/facilities_deduped.csv` as a canonical list of facilities and
`gazeteer_messy.csv` as a list to be matched with the canonical list. Runs
through an interactive training session and produces the following outputs:

  - gazetteer_output.csv - The output of the matching process.
  - gazetteer_training.json - The results of the interactive training session.
  - gazetteer_learned_settings - The trained data model


#### oar_gazetteer_example_pass_2.py

Usage: `python oar_gazetteer_example_pass_2.py`

Reads `../dedupe/facilities_deduped.csv` as a canonical list of facilities,
`gazeteer_messy_pass_2.csv` as a list to be matched with the canonical list, and
`gazatteer_learned_settings`, the model trained by a previous run of
`oar_gazetteer_example.py`. Produces the following outputs:

  - gazetteer_pass_2_output.csv - The output of the matching process.
